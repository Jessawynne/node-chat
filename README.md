#node-chat App

This is a very basic Node.js app that utilizes [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) to create a real-time chat in the browser. It also uses some of the new features from [ES6](http://es6-features.org/#Constants).

###Tools Used

Node, Express, Socket.IO, PostgreSQL, Jade, Nodemon

###Getting Started

#####To clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Jessawynne/node-chat.git
cd ./node-chat
```

#####To install dependencies:

``` 
$ npm install
```

#####To view app in browser:


```
$ npm run start
```

Now open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ in two different browser windows to start and use the app.
